# r6s-DBMS
This is a database built to model the largest multiplayer tactical first person shooter game - Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.
I have designed this database by first modelling an ER diagram after several drafts, a relational schema mapping it into tables, and ensure appropriate functional dependancy and normalization to the Boyce Codd form. I have intergated my database with a python script using mysql-connector where I have created a simple GUI that allows users to query the database's tables, views and so on.
